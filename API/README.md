# NiMMbus API

The NiMMbus service is an OGC Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) implementation developed by the MiraMon team of the Grumets research group in the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona and the CREAF, based on the previous NiMMbus system and evolved as a contribution to the H2020 NextGEOSS project. The NextGEOSS project has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 730329. Currently GUF is being extended through the H2020 Eiffel project, under grant agreement 101003518, to extend quality elements to capture quality metadata in climate change scenarios, as well as to extend GUF features to store and share knowledge elements.

The NiMMbus API is based on the CRUD (create, retrieve, update, and delete) 4 basic functions for persistent storage/management of objects (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). The API defines a set of object classes and provide mainly the 4 CRUD operations plus some additions when considered necessary. In this way, it mimics some of the RESTful design principles too.

The NiMMbus API uses the OGC WPS 1.0 standard but with 2 significant modifications:
* The WPS execute request uses the WPS 1.0 abstract model but is implemented as GET requests (not present in the WPS 1.0 standard.
* The CREATE, MODIFY (update) and DELETE operations are implicitly asynchronous and respond a synchronization ID (more or less equivalent to the job id introduced in WPS 2.0 standard). An extra operation allows for requesting NB_SYNC:GETRETURN the status of the asynchronous process or the actual result if the process has ended.

## General request parameters
* All request are in KVP and have these 3 parameters:
  * SERVICE=WPS
  * REQUEST=EXECUTE
  * IDENTIFIER=NB_{class_type}:{operation}
* In the following descriptions a parameter ending by _# means that the parameters can be used n times substituting the # by sequential numbers starting by 1.

## General response
All responses follow the WPS 1.0 specified XML syntax except the NB_RESOURCE:ENUMERATE request that follows ATOM syntax.

## General exceptions
All responses follow the WPS 1.0 specified XML syntax for exceptions.

	To manage targets of a feedback, there are three strategies available at the moment:

	 2. If one or more TARGET_# and TARGET_ROLE_# couples are defined, then ALL the previous targets of this feedback are deleted and the new list is described
	 3. There is also the possibility of giving only one TARGET_1= empty, and this mean that the current targets are deleted on no one is added (so the feedback has no targets after this modification (that should not happen, in fact))
