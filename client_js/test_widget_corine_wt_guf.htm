        <dd><p style="text-align: justify; ">CORINE Land Cover (CLC) was specified to standardize data collection on land in Europe to support environmental policy development. The reference year of first CLC inventory was 1990 (CLC1990), and the first update created in 2000. Later the update cycle has become 6 years. The number of participating countries has increased over time - currently includes 33 European Environment Agency (EEA) member countries and six cooperating countries (EEA39) with a total area of over 5.8 Mkm<sup>2</sup>. Ortho-corrected high spatial resolution satellite images provide the geometrical and thematic basis for mapping. In-situ data (topographic maps, ortho-photos and ground survey data) are essential ancillary information. The project is coordinated by the EEA in the frame of the EU Copernicus programme and implemented by national teams under the management and quality control (QC) of the EEA. The basic technical parameters of CLC (i.e. 44 classes in nomenclature, 25 hectares minimum mapping unit (MMU) and 100 meters minimum mapping width) have not changed since the beginning, therefore the results of the different inventories are comparable.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">The layer of CORINE Land Cover Changes (CLCC) is produced since the second CLC inventory (CLC2000). CLCC is derived from satellite imagery by direct mapping of changes taken place between two consecutive inventories, based on image-to-image comparison. Change mapping applies a 5 ha MMU to pick up more details in CLCC layer than in CLC status layer. Integration of national CLC and CLCC data includes some harmonization along national borders. Two European validation studies have shown that the achieved thematic accuracy is above the specified minimum (85 %). Primary CLC and CLCC data are in vector format with polygon topology. Derived products in raster format are also available. The seamless European CLC and CLCC time series data (CLC1990, CLC2000, CLC2006, CLC2012 and related CLCC data) are distributed in the standard European Coordinate Reference System defined by the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (ETRS89) datum and Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection (EPSG: 3035). Results of the CLC inventories can be downloaded from Copernicus Land site free of charge for all users.</p>
<p class="abstract" style="text-align: justify; ">CLC data can contribute to a wide range of studies with European coverage, e.g.: ecosystem mapping, modelling the impacts of climate change, landscape fragmentation by roads, abandonment of farm land and major structural changes in agriculture, urban sprawl, water management.</p></dd>

<p style="text-align: justify; ">Main purpose of the release: Publication of the final, corrected CLC 2012 data.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">The 4<sup>th</sup> CLC inventory for the reference year of 2012 was produced under the Copernicus Initial Operations (GIO). It has the shortest production time in history of CLC. Two high-resolution satellite image coverages (IRS Resourcesat-1/2, SPOT-4/5, RapidEye constellation) taken in 2011-2012 provided multi-temporal information to support the update. Computer Assisted Photointerpretation (CAPI) was the prevailing methodology applied in interpreting of satellite images. FI, DE, IC, IE, NO, ES and SE applied a semi-automatic methodology. UK has turned from semiautomatic processing to CAPI because no national hi-res dataset was available for 2012. Most of the QC was conducted in remote verifications. IT and ES were verified by regions. In producing the European products, a simplified border matching was applied (see Version 15). An independent validation of CLC and CLCC for CLC 2012 was carried out in 2016 and the results are available at http://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library/clc-2012-validation-report-1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; "> Changes from previous main release (Version 17):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; ">
<li>Inclusion of CLC 2012 layers for all the EEA39 countries.</li>
<li>Production of CLC 2006 for Greece (in V18_3) and all CLCs for Channel Islands (V18_1).</li>
<li>Revised CLC 2000 and CLC 2006 layers were made available (V18_5).</li>
<li>Change in rasterization algorithm (V18_2).</li>

<p style="text-align: justify; ">Known problems:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; ">
<li>Some redundant lines between neighbouring polygons with the same code are still present, but only as result of persisting `adaptive tilling´ procedure (limitation of ESRI ArcGIS technology for large datasets).</li>
<li>Polygons &lt;25 ha can be present along national borders and along 'adaptive tilling' tiles boundaries.</li>

Dual date satellite imagery (SPOT-4/5 and IRS P6) taken in 2005-2007 provided enhanced change mapping capabilities. Some of the countries newly entering CLC have produced CLC 2000 datasets also during the project time frame. Scanned topographic maps and digital aerial ortho-imagery have become commonly available. CAPI was the prevailing method applied in interpreting of satellite images. Nevertheless, FI, IS, NO, SE and the UK applied a semiautomatic methodology. Most of the European QC was conducted by visiting national teams (see Version 2). In some cases, remote verification was applied (without mission to countries). ES and IT were verified by regions.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Changes from previous release (V14 (V4)):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; ">
<li>CLC 2006 data covering Great Britain (part of UK) and TR were delivered. Thus, CLC 2006 European coverage includes 38 countries of the EEA39. Still missing CLC 2006 data for Greece.</li>
<li>A simplified border matching was applied for countries new in CLC: XK, NO, CH and Turkey: 1) &lt;25 ha polygons along the borders are not removed systematically; 2) sliver-like polygons (area &lt; cca. 5 ha) are generalised to largest or thematically most similar neighbour.</li>
<li>For the rest of CLC 2006 countries a simple border-matching was applied. Code differences along two sides of borders are not changed. Only polygons with area = 0,1 ha (sliver polygons) are eliminated.<i> </i></li>
<li>Data dissemination: CLC data become freely accessible from the EEA to any person or legal entity.</li>

<li>CLC 2006 European coverage includes 37 full countries of EEA39.  New data for Northern Ireland (part of the UK), Madeira Islands (part of PT), CH, IS and TR were added to CLC 2006 data. Still missing CLC 2006: GR and the UK (except Northern Ireland).</li>
<li>New data for Madeira Islands (PT), CH and IS were added into the European CLC 2000 coverage, which includes already the EE39. However, CLCC (1990, 2000) is available for 28 countries only.</li>
<li>New data for Madeira Islands (PT) were added into CLC 1990 and CLCC (1990, 2000). Still missing CLC 1990 data: AL, BA, CH, CY, FI, IS, MK, NO, SE, TR, UK and XK.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify; "> </p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">The seamless European database has been further improved addressing feedback from the EEA on V13 (V3):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; ">
<li>No-data buffer (code 999) outside of valid data area was deleted.</li>
<li>Small gaps identified in V13 were corrected by tolerance adaptation in ArcGIS v10 geodatabase.</li>
<li>Remaining neighbour polygons with the same code were resolved by additional dissolve operation.</li>

<p style="text-align: justify; ">The 2<sup>nd</sup> CLC inventory for the reference year of 2000 (CLC 2000) was carried out in the frames of I&amp;CLC 2000 project. A single date Landsat-7 ETM satellite imagery taken in 1999-2001 was provided by JRC. The technology of drawing the interpretation on transparencies was discarded and replaced by CAPI (computer-assisted photo-interpretation). Prior to mapping changes CLC 1990 data had to be corrected: 1) bulk geometric mistakes removed and residual geometric errors &gt;100 m and coding mistakes were corrected; 2) polygons smaller than the 25 ha MMU were generalised. European QC was conducted by visiting national teams (usually at the start and towards the end of the project). Computer-assisted verification has provided written, geo-located explanations regarding the mistakes and supported harmonized production of the database all over Europe.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; ">Changes from previous release (V1):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify; ">
<li>It was to deliver a single seamless layer, but was not feasible in ESRI environment. Therefore, seamless ESRI ArcInfo Librarian map tiles were produced again (but free of tiling artefacts reported in V1).</li>
<li>New country deliveries integrated into European CLC 2000 ME, RS (incl. XK), IS and NO. Simple harmonization along national borders of these countries was done (small artefacts cleaned only).</li>
<li>CLC 2000 data for MT have been updated to reflect changed geometry in CLC 2006 delivery.</li>
<li>The dissemination and use of products was defined in an agreement between the EEA, the EC and the participating countries.</li>
