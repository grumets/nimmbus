<h2 class="white-area-title"><b>Access Policy of NiMMbus</b></h2>
<p align="right" id="last_updated"><i>Last updated: 06-10-2020</i></p>

<p>This Access Policy ("Policy", "Access Policy") sets a baseline standard and requires procedures for all user access (e.g. managing, reviewing and
validating) to the information in <a href="https://www.opengis.uab.cat/nimmbus">https://www.opengis.uab.cat/nimmbus</a> website (the "Service") operated by CREAF (and GRUMETS research group) ("us", "we", or "our").</p>
<p>The NiMMbus JavaScript client as well as the widget are developed by the Grumets research group under the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html#AGPL">GNU Affero General Public License</a>. The NiMMbus was developed under the NextGEOSS that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 730329, and is being continued under the EIFFEL that has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 101003518.</p>

<p>It is the policy of CREAF that access to the Service will be allowed only for persons who meet the
conditions identified and documented in this Policy and the Terms of Use. Any person who does not
meet one of these conditions shall be prohibited from access. Despite the fact that the service can be connected to other services or managed by other organizations, access is not granted to organizations or services, but to individuals using the Service. The same individual can contribute feedback to resources that are managed in several services that are owned by more than one organization. Each user editing any resource or accessing non-public domain resources shall be granted access using a unique ID and an account. Sharing of accounts without explicit permission of the administrator constitutes a Security Violation.
User rights are to be granted using the principle of "Least privilege and need to know". Granting rights to an unnecessary number of resources constitutes a Security Violation.</p>

<p>To allow for efficiency, roles may be combined, and access rights shall be granted on the basis 
of potential "Need to know". We have determined an appropriate set of
functional roles that adequately define what users require access to. At a minimum, the functional
roles accommodate the following use types:
</p><ul>
<li>A guest account (read only)
</li><li>Unprivileged accounts (read, write, share)
</li><li>Privileged administrator accounts (all)
</li></ul>

<p>Access is granted to administrators based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Least privilege and need to know: Users will only be granted access to the Service for the purpose of executing their
tasks and duties. Administrator rights shall not be granted unless there is a legitimate business need.
</li><li>Segregation of duties: Users should not be able to grant themselves rights. Administrative
accounts shall be monitored. To the maximum extent logs shall be maintained.
</li><li>Role based access: Users will be assigned access rights to the Service based on functional roles they
assume in the course of doing their business.
</li></ul>

<p>Please read this Access Policy carefully before using the Service.</p>

<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with this Policy. This Policy applies to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

<p>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by this Policy. If you disagree with any part of the policy, then you shall not access the Service.</p>

<h3>Account Types</h3>
<p>Provisioning of accounts and their privileges across the Service must conform to the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Default accounts (accounts available out-of-the box; e.g. "Administrator") or default password will not be defined or used
</li><li>Guest access will be possible only to the resources declared as "Share to everyone" by other users and will be limited to "Read only". The Guest account will be anonymous and will have no password.
</li><li>Unprivileged individual accounts will be able to read "Share to everyone" resources, read and write their own resources and the resources others have shared with them. They will be able to share with specific users or to declare as "Share to everyone" resources they own or resources to which they have been given "share" permission by others.
</li><li>Privileged individual administration accounts shall be created only where needed to manage the Service. Privileged administrator will only be granted to CREAF employees or employees of their consortium member organizations. 
</ul>
<p>The users of the Service accept that accounts are managed by the service. An account may be created directly in the Service and associated to a password. Passwords are stored encrypted and will not be available to anybody, including the administrator. When a new user connects through an external authentication provider for the first time, a Service account will be automatically created. When an external authentication provider is used, no password is validated or stored by the Service (and the authentication is controlled by temporary tokens).</p>

<h3>Access Log Inspection</h3>
The use of accounts and data will be logged and monitored by CREAF. Users agree that the logs are inspected. Logs are not to be accessible in the web. 

<h3>De-Provisioning</h3>
<p>An account may be suspended or deleted by an administrator without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including 
without limitation a breach of this Policy, the Terms of Use or Security Violations. An account will be deleted under request from the user.</p>
<p>An audit of all accounts may be conducted to ensure that all active accounts are provisioned only to authorized individuals. Accounts inactive for more than one year may be suspended or deleted.</p>

<h3>Governing Law</h3>
<p>This Policy and the rest of the conditions of this site will be governed in accordance with the Spanish legislation.</p>
<p>Spanish law will govern any dispute or conflict deriving from this Policy or from the use of the Portal, its Contents, or its Services, 
or relating to any of these, while conflict-of-law provisions that could be applied will have no effect. You agree to be subject 
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Barcelona, to solve complaints deriving from this Policy or related to them.</p><p>

</p><h3>Changes</h3>
<p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace 
this Policy at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to 
provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new policy taking effect. 
What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole 
discretion.</p>
<p>By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions 
become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised policy. If you do 
not agree to the new policy, please stop using the Service.</p>
