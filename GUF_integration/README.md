# Instructions for the integration of the GUF system (based on the NiMMbus service) in your resources

The NiMMbus service is an OGC Geospatial User Feedback (GUF) implementation developed by the MiraMon team of the Grumets research group in the Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona and the CREAF, based on the previous NiMMbus system and evolved as a contribution to the H2020 NextGEOSS project. The NextGEOSS project has received funding from the European Union Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 730329. Currently GUF is being extended through the H2020 Eiffel project, under grant agreement 101003518, to extend quality elements to capture quality metadata in climate change scenarios, as well as to extend GUF features to store and share knowledge elements.

This page provides general instructions for the GUF integration with your resources. They can be part of your catalogue or can be individual web pages. A "resource" can be anything that has an identifier in the web. Nevertheless, it is expected that your resources have some spatial component. In this page we explain two ways to integrate the Geospatial User Feedback in your web application:

 * The first one offers a **JavaScript API and a widget** that is very simple to integrate but, in contrast, provides a relative low level of flexibility. People with basic knowledge on JavaScript should select this one first. Basic knowledge on how to call a JavaScript function and include a library is required.

 * The second one offers access to the **Javascript for the Web API** where the programmer retrieves directly the feedback items encoded in XML and should generate a presentation himself/herself. It provides full control on how the content is shown in the screen, but it requires considerable more knowledge on JavaScript programming, including XML parsing and AJAX calls.

There is a more complex and flexible possibility based on communicating with the server directly using the *Web API*. That will require to build a GUI for providing feedback that can take many days to build. For more information about the Web API see: [Web API](../API).

Since the first level is built on top of second level, you can investigate how to use the second level by inspecting the JavaScript code provided in the libraries used in the first level. You can create your own intermediate levels by reusing some part of this code in your own application.

## What do you need to know before integrating the GUF

The integration offered in this page assumes that you want to provide feedback about a **single resource**. Provide feedback about several resources in a single page is also possible but you might require calling the widget several times or from several places.

To be able to start working with the integration, you need to have your resources uniquely identified in your system using a "code" (a.k.a. an identifier). Only identified resources can be associated to feedback items. This "code" needs to be unique in a "codespace". The combination of "code" and "codespace" should provide an identifier that can be considered unique and global. If you do not use the concept of "codespace" or "namespace", we recommend that you use the URL of your web service as the "codespace". Generally, the "codespace" is common to all your resources and can be hardcoded in your application.

## Option 1: JavaScript API and widget

You can see this procedure in action in the following working examples:
  * <a href="http://maps.ecopotential-project.eu" target="_blank">integration with the ECOPotential</a>: click on a dataset name and select Feedback. A new window with previous feedback items and a button to add new ones is shown.
  * <a href="http://www.eneon.net/graph-ev-sdg" target="_blank">integration with the ENEON Graph</a>: click on an element on the network and below you will see its characteristics as well as a link to see and add feedback items about it.

The integration is extremely simple.

### Step 1: Include the JavaScript library in your HTML page
The modular library is composed of several JavaScript files and a style sheet that should be included in your Javascript application at the beginning of you web page, commonly in the <head> section. To ease the integration only the main JavaScript file and the CSS need to be directly included pointing to the full URL. Currently, to avoid CORS error, we recommend to get the files from [here](../client_js/) and point them with a relative URL:

```js
<link rel="stylesheet" href="guf.css">
<script language="JavaScript" src="guf.js"></script>
```

Be aware that more than those two files need to be downloaded, as they are indirectly included by guf.js. The list of complete files follow below and you can get them all downloading this [ZIP file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joanma747/nimmbus/master/client_js/widget_files.zip):
  * guf.css
  * guf.js
  * guf_locale.js
  * Nmmblang.js
  * owc_atom.js
  * wps_iso_guf.js
  * xml.js

The inclusion of a style sheet (guf.css) is needed in order to have a special style for the detailed description in citations and publications. This detailed description is initially folded and can be shown by clicking on a *"Click to show/hide more information"* text in the description. This guf.css style sheet is also used to describe several classes to select how different elements will be displayed. There is a by default style described on the widget, but you can modify how this elements are displayed (e.g. different font family, font color, background color, even which elements are displayed) if including a class ".XXX.user" in your style sheet (where "XXX" is substituted by the class you want to modify).

Please check the following examples to see how these styles are used (the three test pages are showing feedback items for the same resource):
   * [test_widget.htm](../client_js/test_widget.htm): default style (grey background) is used for extended description in citations and publications. You can also see the example in the same test page in the official NiMMbus service: https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget.htm
   * [test_widget_custom.htm](../client_js/test_widget_custom.htm): custom style is used as family font and font color is change for all elements, and background color is changed for extended description in citations and publications. You can also see the example in the same test page in the official NiMMbus service: https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget_custom.htm
   * [test_widget_corine.htm](../client_js/test_widget_corine.htm): a different style (blue background) is used for extended description in citations and publications, Moreover, some elements have been hidden (guf_purpose, guf_contact_role, guf_date and guf_usage) to obtain shorter descriptions of feedback items. You can also see the example in the same test page in the official NiMMbus service: https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget_corine.htm
   * [test_widget_multitarget.htm](../client_js/test_widget_multitarget.htm): the same styling than the first test page but creating a multiple target user feedback item. In this test page a two-target user feedback item is created, with one primary target (a certain subarea within the Sentinel 2 L2A collection) default style (grey background) is used for extended description in citations and publications. You can also see the example in the same test page in the official NiMMbus service: https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget_multitarget.htm
   * [test_new_feedback.htm](../client_js/test_new_feedback.htm): if a user is trying to create a feedback about a citation not yet stored in NiMMbus, the system first creates the citation element (with a `title` an `identifier` and a `nameSpace`) and then the feedback. You can also see the example in the same test page in the official NiMMbus service: https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_new_feedback.htm

The list of the classes defined in guf.css style sheet, and which part of the feedback item description they refer to, is described in [GUF.css Reference](../GUF_integration/guf_css.md).

### Step 2: Define a division in your HTML page
The GUF widget will be shown in the area of the page you want. You should define a division using relative position. In case of a relative division, the size will be dimensioned automatically when it is populated and what is below the division will be moved down to avoid overlapping with the GUF widget.

```js
<div id="div_guf" style="position: relative; width: 60%"></div>
```

In the example we create a division with the identifier "div_guf". For the moment, the division is small and it is not visible to the user because it has no content.

### Step 3: Fill the division with the GUF widget

There are several options depending on the parameters that need to be sent to the GUF:
 * Option 1: Feedback about a single primary target
 * Option 2: Feedback about multiple targets
 * Option 3: Feedback including reproducible usage

#### Option 1: Feedback about a single primary target

The first option to create feedback, related to a single primary targets, will require that you call a JavaScript function with the name: *GUFShowFeedbackInHTMLDiv()*.

This function has the following parameters in sequence:
  * _elem_: The object that points to the division created in step 2. To get the object you can call a common JavaScript procedure: _document.getElementById("div_guf")_.
  * _seed_div_id_: A prefix for some divisions that are going to be created inside the widget. Having this name will allow you get access to the text created in the division or even to manipulate it.
  * _rsc_type_: A text that is shown as the name of the resource. You can use "resource", "dataset" or a more concrete text for this resource in particular.
  * _title_: If there is no previous feedback about this resource, a citation is created in the GUF system that includes this "title".
  * _code_: A unique identifier of the resource in your system.
  * _codespace_: A "codespace" where the "code" is considered unique. A codespace should be a global identifier (e.g. a URI). If you do not use the concept of "codespace" or "namespace", we recommend that you use the URL of your web service as the "codespace".
  * _lang_: The language used in the HTML page. You can select among "cat", "spa" or "eng" for Catalan, Spanish or English respectively.
  * _access_token_type_: In case the portal including the widget is using one of the supported Single-Sign-On (SSO) systems, it can be described here to allow the desired credentials to be used, thus avoiding the log-in step. Supported systems are: "NextGEOSS", "LandSense", "Google" or "NiMMbus" (being the latter the default value).
  * _name_scope_function_: Can be null. If added it refers to the name of the function to be defined in your map browser that will activate the tool to define the scope of a feedback. This function will receive as input parameters _targets_, _lang_ and _access_token_type_ of the layer to add feedback and it must add the attributes _.bbox_ and _.gmlpol_ to the target element. **_.bbox_** will contain the geographic coordinates in WGS84 of the bounding box following the format ```target[i].bbox={"xmin":minLon, "xmax":maxLon, "ymin": minLat, "ymax":maxLat}```. **_.gmlpol_** will contain a string with the gml codification of the area of interest selected by the user following the format ``` target[i].gmlpol={"gml":'<gml:Polygon srsName="EPSG:4326"><gml:exterior><gml:LinearRing><gml:posList srsDimension="2">41.81 1.46 41.81 2.73 40.88 2.73 40.88 1.46 41.81 .46</gml:posList></gml:LinearRing> </gml:exterior></gml:Polygon>'}```). At the end of the process, _name_scope_function_ must invoke **_GUFAfegirFeedbackCapaMultipleTargets(targets, lang, access_token_type)_**.
	
For example, a call to this function could be:

```js
	GUFShowFeedbackInHTMLDiv(document.getElementById("div_guf"),
			"div_guf_internal",
			"resource",
			"Corine Land Cover 2012",
			"clc-2012",
			"https://land.copernicus.eu",
			"eng",
      			"NextGEOSS",
			"MostraFinestraFeedbackAmbScope");
```

You can call the function directly or you can provide a button or link to "activate" the widget when the user requests it. This can be done with this code:

```html
<a href="javascript:void();" onClick='GUFShowFeedbackInHTMLDiv(document.getElementById("div_guf"), "div_guf_internal", "resource",
"Corine Land Cover 2012", "clc-2012", "https://land.copernicus.eu", "eng", "NextGEOSS");'>Add user feedback or review previous feedback</a>
```

You can see all elements together in a general example (using a button) here: [code](../client_js/test_widget.htm) and [test_widget](https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget.htm). You can also check an example applied to the Corine Land Cover 2012 metadata page (using a link) here: [code](../client_js/test_widget_corine.htm) and [test_widget_corine](https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget_corine.htm).

#### Option 2: Feedback about multiple targets

The second option to create feedback is to relate it to several targets, each of them with a certain role (at least one of them needs to be "primary"). In this case, the JavaScript function that needs to be used is: *GUFShowFeedbackMultipleTargetsInHTMLDiv()*.

This function has the following parameters in sequence:
  * _elem_: As in the previous function, the object that points to the division created in step 2. To get the object you can call a common JavaScript procedure: _document.getElementById("div_guf")_.
  * _seed_div_id_: As in the previous function, a prefix for some divisions that are going to be created inside the widget. Having this name will allow you get access to the text created in the division or even to manipulate it.
  * _rsc_type_: As in the previous function, text that is shown as the name of the resource. You can use "resource", "dataset" or a more concrete text for this resource in particular.
  * _targets_: in this case, instead of describing a single target with three different parameters, as in the previous function, a single "targets" parameter, which is an array, includes the description of the list of targets.
     * The structure of each element of the array has to be: _{title: "title target 1", code: "code target 1", codespace: "codespace target 1", role: "role target 1"}_.
     * The elements of each element of the array are as follows:
        * _title_: As in the previous function, the title of this target.
        * _code_: As in the previous function, a unique identifier of this resource in your system.
        * _codespace_: As in the previous function, a "codespace" where the "code" is considered unique.
        *  _role_: The role of this target related to the feedback item that is being created. The available options are: "primary", "secondary" or "supplementary"
  * _lang_: As in the previous function,  the language used in the HTML page. You can select among "cat", "spa" or "eng" for Catalan, Spanish or English respectively.
  * _access_token_type_: As in the previous function, in case the portal including the widget is using one of the supported Single-Sign-On (SSO) systems, it can be described here to allow the desired credentials to be used, thus avoiding the log-in step. Supported systems are: "NextGEOSS", "LandSense", "Google" or "NiMMbus" (being the latter the default value).
  * _name_scope_function_: Can be null. If added it refers to the name of the function to be defined in your map browser that will activate the tool to define the scope of a feedback. This function will receive as input parameters _targets_, _lang_ and _access_token_type_ of the layer to add feedback and it must add the attributes _.bbox_ and _.gmlpol_ to the target element. **_.bbox_** will contain the geographic coordinates in WGS84 of the bounding box following the format ```target[i].bbox={"xmin":minLon, "xmax":maxLon, "ymin": minLat, "ymax":maxLat}```. **_.gmlpol_** will contain a string with the gml codification of the area of interest selected by the user following the format ``` target[i].gmlpol={"gml":'<gml:Polygon srsName="EPSG:4326"><gml:exterior><gml:LinearRing><gml:posList srsDimension="2">41.81 1.46 41.81 2.73 40.88 2.73 40.88 1.46 41.81 .46</gml:posList></gml:LinearRing> </gml:exterior></gml:Polygon>'}```). At the end of the process, _name_scope_function_ must invoke **_GUFAfegirFeedbackCapaMultipleTargets(targets, lang, access_token_type)_**.
	
For example, a call to this function could be:

```js
	var targets=[{title: "Sentinel-2B Level-2A 2020-09-22 R051 T30TYL", code: "s2b_msil2a_20200922t104649_n0214_r051_t30tyl_20200927t135033", codespace: "https://catalogue.nextgeoss.eu/", role: "primary"},
  			  {title: "Sentinel-2 Level-2A", code: "SENTINEL2_L2A", codespace: "https://catalogue.nextgeoss.eu/", role: "secondary"}];

	GUFShowFeedbackMultipleTargetsInHTMLDiv(document.getElementById("div_guf"),
			"div_guf_internal",
			"resource",
			targets,
			"eng",
			"NextGEOSS",
			"MostraFinestraFeedbackAmbScope");
```

You can see a multiple targets example (using a button) here: [code](../client_js/test_widget_multitarget.htm) and [test_widget_multitarget](https://www.nimmbus.cat/test_widget_multitarget.htm). This test page for multitargets describes the same example than before: dataset as primary target and collection as secondary target.

#### Option 3: Feedback including reproducible usage

This option is the more advanced one. In this case, typically a portal uses user feedback to store and retrieve user feedback items including reproducible usage in a two steps process:
  * _Creating the feedback items_: the portal integrating the GUF is creating the feedback items that includes reproducible usage of a certain type. In fact in a single portal more than one type of reproducible usage can be typically created, for example to include new style descriptions (of an existing layer in the portal) or new layer descriptions.
  * _Retrieving the feedback items_: if some feedback items including reproducible usage have been stored before, the portal can retrieve and list them, for another user to apply them. For example, a user can retrieve an browse styles for a certain layer, described by other users previously, and select to apply some of them.

Each of these two steps uses a different function, which are explained in the following subsections.

##### 3.1 Creating feedback items with reproducible usage

In this first step, to create the feedback item which includes reproducible usage, the JavaScript function that needs to be used is: *GUFCreateFeedbackWithReproducibleUsage()*. Typically thus function is used within a button or right-button menu, and triggers the opening of a NiMMbus window where the details of the feedback item including reproducible usage are shown, and the user can modify or add details and save the feedback element.

This function has the following parameters in sequence:
* _targets_: a single "targets" parameter, which is an array, includes the description of the list of targets.
   * The structure of each element of the array has to be: _{title: "title target 1", code: "code target 1", codespace: "codespace target 1", role: "primary"}_.
   * The elements of each element of the array are as follows:
      * _title_: As in the previous function, the title of this target.
      * _code_: As in the previous function, a unique identifier of this resource in your system.
      * _codespace_: As in the previous function, a "codespace" where the "code" is considered unique.
      *  _role_: The role of this target related to the feedback item that is being created. The available options are: "primary", "secondary" or "supplementary"
* _reprod_usage_: this parameter is a structure including several elements:
   * _abstract_: abstract of the feedback item, it can be, for example, the title assigned to the shared style
   * _specific_usage_: Which is the general description of the usage described, for example "Share style"
   * _ru_code_: code describing the reproducible usage, for example, the JSON dhe code (previous element), tipically can have values such as "application/json" for JSON, "text/x-python" for Phyton, "text/x-r-source" for R, "application/x-bat" for a Windows command line, "application/x-sh" for a Linux command line, "application/wpsex+xml" for a WPS execute document, "application/KVP" for a Key-value pair (KVP), "application/vnd.docker" for a Docker container" or empty for others
   * _ru_platform_: platform in which this reproducible usage can be applied. This not need to exactly refer to the URL that has created this (as usually used in the target code_space), but usually to a general URL describing the product, for example https://github.com/joanma747/MiraMonMapBrowser
   * _ru_version_: version of the platform in which this reproducible usage can be applied, for example "6.0"escription of the style that is being shared. Is the piece of code that in the second step, the portal will retrieve and apply
   * _ru_code_media_type_: description of the media type of t
   * _ru_schema_: type of reproducible usage within the platform, to be able to select several types of reproducible usages with different purposes, for example for sharing styles or layers. Sometimes it can be described as a section in a configuration file, but this is not mandatory.
   * _ru_sugg_app_: specific suggested application that can be used to load the reproducible usage. Usually an specific instance of the generic _ru_platform_. If not specified it is automatically determined from "location.href". To avoid automatic value use ru_sugg_app=null;
* _lang_: As in the previous function,  the language used in the HTML page. You can select among "cat", "spa" or "eng" for Catalan, Spanish or English respectively.
* _access_token_type_: As in the previous function, in case the portal including the widget is using one of the supported Single-Sign-On (SSO) systems, it can be described here to allow the desired credentials to be used, thus avoiding the log-in step. Supported systems are: "NextGEOSS", "LandSense", "Google" or "NiMMbus" (being the latter the default value).

Example of use:

```js
	var targets=[{title: "Sentinel 2 L2A", code: "DonanaSentinel2Level2a", codespace: "https://www.datacube.cat/cgi-bin/ecopotential/miramon.cgi", role: "primary"}];
  var reprod_usage={
    abstract: "Salinity Index-9: (NIRxR)/G",
    specific_usage: "Share style",
    ru_code: JSON.stringify({"nom":null,"desc":"Salinity Index-9: (NIRxR)/G","TipusObj":"P","component":[{"calcul":"({\"i_capa\":78,\"i_valor\":7}*{\"i_capa\":78,\"i_valor\":3})/{\"i_capa\":78,\"i_valor\":2}","FormulaConsulta":"(v[7]*v[3])/v[2]","estiramentPaleta":{"valorMinim":0,"valorMaxim":7000}}],"metadades":null,"nItemLlegAuto":20,"ncol":4,"descColorMultiplesDe":0.01,"origen":"usuari"}),
    ru_code_media_type: "application/json",
    ru_platform: "https://github.com/joanma747/MiraMonMapBrowser",
    ru_version: "6.0",
    ru_schema: "config-schema.json#/definitions/estil",
    ru_sugg_app: "http://maps.ecopotential-project.eu"};

    GUFCreateFeedbackWithReproducibleUsage(targets, reprod_usage, "eng", "NextGEOSS");    
```    

##### 3.2 Retrieving feedback items with reproducible usage

In this second step, to retrieve (and use) the feedback item including reproducible usage, the JavaScript function that needs to be used is: *GUFShowPreviousFeedbackWithReproducibleUsageInHTMLDiv()*. Typically this function is used within a button or right-button menu, which opens a window showing the previous feedback items which include reproducible usage of a certain type, and may allow to apply them to the portal.

* _elem_: As in the GUFShowFeedbackInHTMLDiv() function, the object that points to the division created in step 2. To get the object you can call a common JavaScript procedure: _document.getElementById("div_guf")_.
* _seed_div_id_: As in the GUFShowFeedbackInHTMLDiv() function, a prefix for some divisions that are going to be created inside the widget. Having this name will allow you get access to the text created in the division or even to manipulate it.
* _code_: A unique identifier of the resource in your system. No need of several targets as only the  primary one is needed.
* _codespace_: A "codespace" where the "code" is considered unique. A codespace should be a global identifier (e.g. a URI). If you do not use the concept of "codespace" or "namespace", we recommend that you use the URL of your web service as the "codespace".
* _reprod_usage_: this parameter is to describe the "type" of reproducible usage that will be retrieved and needs the platform, version and schema
(typically as in the related creation function GUFCreateFeedbackWithReproducibleUsage()):
   * _ru_platform_: platform in which this reproducible usage can be applied. This not need to exactly refer to the URL that has created this (as usually used in the target code_space), but usually to a general URL describing the product, for example https://github.com/joanma747/MiraMonMapBrowser
   * _ru_version_: version of the platform in which this reproducible usage can be applied, for example "6.0"
   * _ru_schema_: type of reproducible usage within the platform, to be able to select several types of reproducible usages with different purposes, for example for sharing styles or layers. Sometimes it can be described as a section in a configuration file, but this is not mandatory.
   * _ru_sugg_app_: specific suggested application that can be used to load the reproducible usage. Usually an specific instance of the generic _ru_platform_. If not specified it is automatically determined from "location.href". To avoid automatic value use ru_sugg_app=null;
* _lang_: As in the previous function,  the language used in the HTML page. You can select among "cat", "spa" or "eng" for Catalan, Spanish or English respectively.
* _access_token_type_: As in the previous function, in case the portal including the widget is using one of the supported Single-Sign-On (SSO) systems, it can be described here to allow the desired credentials to be used, thus avoiding the log-in step. Supported systems are: "NextGEOSS", "LandSense", "Google" or "NiMMbus" (being the latter the default value).
* _callback_function_: it is a function from the portal including the widget, that will be called when pressing the "Apply" button in the feedback items list that will be created by this function. The function will be be called using the params_function (next parameter) as well as the GUF structure (see wps_iso_guf.js if needed), so internally should be defined for example as: _function AdoptaEstil(params_function, guf)_
* _params_function_: This is a JSON structure defining the internal (of the portal using the widget) parameters that will be passed to the _callaback_funtion_ as first parameter (see above). The widget does not modify this element and will be passed as is.

Example of use:

```js
	var reprod_usage={ru_platform: "https://github.com/joanma747/MiraMonMapBrowser",
    ru_version: "6.0",
    ru_schema: "config-schema.json#/definitions/estil",
    ru_sugg_app: "http://maps.ecopotential-project.eu"};

    GUFShowPreviousFeedbackWithReproducibleUsageInHTMLDiv(document.getElementById("div_guf"),
        "div_guf_internal", "DonanaSentinel2Level2a", "https://www.datacube.cat/cgi-bin/ecopotential/miramon.cgi", reprod_usage, "eng", "NextGEOSS", "AdoptStyle", {i_capa: i_capa});    
```    

## Option 2: JavaScript for the Web API

You can see this procedure in action in the following working examples:
  * [integration with the DAB API](examples/dab/index.htm) ([source code](guf_dab_nimmbus.htm)).
  * [integration with the INSPIRE Portal](examples/inspire/index.htm) ([source code](guf_inspire_nimmbus.htm)).

### Step 1: Include a button to add feedback for resource (e.g. a catalogue entry)

For each entry in a catalogue, a button with a text [Add feedback] is expected, at the end of the general description of the resource.

The button will start another window with the NiMMbus interface (href target=_blank). To ease the process to the user, the link to NiMMbus can be populated with the target_code and target_codespace of the catalogue entry (a target_title is also recommended).

To create the URL please follow the template: https://www.nimmbus.cat?target_title={target_title}&target_code={target_code}&target_codespace={target_codespace}&page=ADDFEEDBACK&share_borrower_1=Anonymous&access_token_type={SSO_system}

At the moment, Single-Sign-On systems available are: NextGEOSS, LandSense, Google or NiMMbus (being "NiMMbus" the default value).

For more details go to this [example](../client_js/test_new_feedback.htm) that allows you to create new feedback items of a certain resource (the citation of the resource is automatically created if needed).

#### How to open the "add feedback" page in a new window
You can use the window.open Javascript function to open the new window. Once the user clicks on save, the window will be closed, and the focus will return to the main page.
```js
window.open("https://www.nimmbus.cat/index.htm?...", "Feedback",'toolbar=no,status=no,scrollbars=yes,location=no,menubar=no,directories=no,resizable=yes,width=800,height=700');
```

The use of the JavaScript function GUFAfegirFeedbackCapa(title, code, codespace, lang) (in guf.js) can simplify this task.

### Step 2: Request feedback about a catalogue entry

For each entry in the catalogue, a list of previous user feedback items is expected to be shown. To do that the NiMMbus API allows for an easy retrieval of this information as an ATOM file format.

To create the URL please follow the ENUMERATE template: https://www.nimmbus.cat/cgi-bin/nimmbus.cgi?SERVICE=WPS&REQUEST=EXECUTE&IDENTIFIER=NB_RESOURCE:ENUMERATE&LANGUAGE=eng&STARTINDEX=1&COUNT=100&FORMAT=text/xml&TYPE=FEEDBACK&TRG_TYPE_1=CITATION&TRG_FLD_1=CODE&TRG_VL_1={catalogue_id}&TRG_OPR_1=EQ&TRG_NXS_1=AND&TRG_TYPE_2=CITATION&TRG_FLD_2=NAMESPACE&TRG_VL_2={catalogue_namespace}&TRG_OPR_2=EQ

To submit a request to the server with a URL without losing the current page content you can use the loadFile() function (in xml.js) that will retrieve the xml document asynchronously.

<!--For more details go to this [example](../client_js/test_retrieve_feedback.htm) that allows you to retrieve the items of a certain resource.-->

Parsing XML in JavaScript is not an easy task. We recommend that you use the following function to convert the ATOM XML encoding to a JavaScript object that follows the OWS Context JSON encoding.
```js
	var owc=ParseOWSContextAtom(doc.documentElement);
	for (var i=0; i<owc.features.length; i++)
	{
		title=owc.features[i].properties.title;
	}
```
See the function CarregaFeedbacksAnteriors() for more details on how to do that.

To get more information about a specific feedback item you have two alternatives:

### Step 3a: Get more information about a specific feedback item all in once
The simpler (but not necessarily appropriate) alternative is to modify the above request to add CONTENT=full. By doing so the full content of the element is inserted in the "content" element of the atom file.

### Step 3b: Get more information about a specific feedback item one by one

The second alternative is to extract the resource_id from the atom response entry and follow the RETRIEVE template: 
https://www.nimmbus.cat/cgi-bin/nimmbus.cgi?SERVICE=WPS&REQUEST=EXECUTE&IDENTIFIER=NB_RESOURCE:RETRIEVE&LANGUAGE=eng&USER=Anonymous&RESOURCE={resource_id}.

Please note that this URL is provided directly in each entry of the atom feed in a link element.

Parsing XML is not easy in JavaScript. We recommend that you use the GetRetrieveResourceFeedbackOutputs() function to convert the XML encoding to a JavaScript object that is easier to use.

```js
	var guf=GetRetrieveResourceFeedbackOutputs(doc.documentElement);
	if (guf.comment)
		comment_text=guf.comment;
```
